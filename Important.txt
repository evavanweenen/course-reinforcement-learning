instructions for running the code, run the code by using main.py,
There are 2 agents in main.py, one is commented out(monte_carlo by default), the policy estimation policy gradient is the one which runs normally. 
Change the comment line in main.py and the code should run smoothly.

joblib is a non-standard python library which you need to install on your device.
Most programming was done in python 3.6, as 3.4 seemed outdated for most devices and libraries, and the online documentation is not easily available below 3.5.
Only tested the code on computers from the Leiden Observatory, as we could not get it run smoothly on Duranium.
